# Uğur Yavuz @dryope
Hi, I'm a SRE and system administrator. Previously I worked on different startups in many different levels, junior software developer to chief technology officer. I'm a huge nerd/geek, API lover, data digger, optimization crazy. 

## My values
🌟 Expression as authentic self<br>
🚀 Focused to growth and success<br>
🤞 Safety and trust<br>
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
🙌 Shared understanding and consensus<br>

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
